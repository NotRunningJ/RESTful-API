# RESTful API
This is an API which follows the constriants of REST I worked on in a team of 3 in my **Distributed Systems** course
The skeleton of the API has a projects, tasks, users, and todolists resources where clients can assign tasks to users inside of projects.
With the server running, it can be tested on something like YARC, which is a free browser extension to test client/server API.
